# USF GDSC's Presents How to Program a Dot Card for a conference 

## CodeLab Overview
Duration: 0:02:00

Dot cards, also known as NFC tags, are small, programmable devices that use NFC technology to communicate information wirelessly. NFC (Near Field Communication) is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to exchange data when they are in close proximity, typically within a few centimeters.

At conferences, dot cards can be used to exchange contact information, share digital business cards, or even link to your professional social media profiles. They offer a convenient and efficient way to network with other attendees without the need for traditional paper business cards.

In this codelab, we will explore how to program a dot card using an NFC-enabled device, such as a smartphone or tablet. Programming a dot card allows you to personalize it with your contact information, making it easier for others to connect with you after the conference.

1. **Resume:** 
   - Keep it concise and relevant to the conference or industry.
   - Highlight key achievements, skills, and experiences that are most relevant to your networking goals.
   - Consider including a QR code on your dot card that links directly to your online resume for easy access.

2. **Linktree:** 
   - Use Linktree to create a simple, mobile-friendly landing page that links to your social media profiles, portfolio, blog, and other relevant online content.
   - Customize the Linktree page to reflect your personal brand and highlight your most important online assets.

3. **Personal Website:** 
   - Make sure your personal website is up-to-date and visually appealing.
   - Include a brief bio, portfolio of work, contact information, and links to your social media profiles.
   - Consider adding a blog or news section to showcase your expertise and interests in your field.

## Environment Setup

In order to get the ground running, we primarily need two things,
1. An NFC Tag 
2. A device with NFC Functionality


#### Install The app to program the NFC Card 

- Apple : [NFC Tools](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749)
- Android : [NFC Tools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&hl=en_US&gl=US)

## Programing the NFC Tag
Duration: 0:02:00

With the app installed and the NFC Tag we are all set to program it. 

1. **Open the NFC Tools app** on your device.

2. **Tap on the "Write" option** in the app menu.

3. **Select the type of information in 'Add record' menu** you want to program into the NFC Tag. For example, you can choose to write a URL, text, or contact information.

4. **Enter the desired information** in the provided fields. For a URL, enter the web address of your Linktree or personal website. For text, you can enter a brief introduction or any other message you want to share.

5. **Hold the NFC Tag close to the back of your device** to start the writing process. Ensure that the NFC Tag is placed on a flat surface for better communication.

6. **Wait for the writing process to complete**. You will receive a notification when the writing is successful.

7. **Test the NFC Tag** by holding it close to your device to see if it triggers the desired action, such as opening a web page or displaying text.

## Level 1 
Duration: 0:03:00

**Resume**

- Upload your resume to Google Drive and make sure it is set to public.
- Get the public link of your resume from Google Drive.
- Use this link to program your tag


## Level 2 
Duration: 0:05:00

**Linktree**

- Create a Linktree account and set up your profile.
- Add your social media profiles, portfolio, blog, and other relevant online content to your Linktree page.
- Customize the Linktree page to reflect your personal brand and highlight your most important online assets.
- Get the Linktree link to your profile.
- Use the NFC Tools app to program the NFC Tag with the Linktree link.

## Level 3 
Duration: 0:15:00

In this codelab, we will learn how to fork a repository on GitHub, open the forked repository on your GitHub website, edit the required fields, and host the repository using GitHub Pages.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Go to the repository [USFGDSC/portfolioWebsite](https://github.com/USFGDSC/portfolioWebsite).
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page.
3. Select your GitHub account to fork the repository into your account.

### Step 2: Open the Forked Repository on GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub account and navigate to the forked repository.
2. Click on the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL of the repository.

### Step 3: Open the Repository in GitHub Codespaces
1. Go to your GitHub account and navigate to the forked repository.
2. Click on the "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces".
3. Wait for Codespaces to initialize and open the repository in the Codespaces environment.

### Step 4: Edit the Required Fields
1. In the Codespaces environment, navigate to the files you want to edit.
2. Make the necessary changes to the files.
3. Save your changes and commit them to the repository.

### Step 5: Host the Repository Using GitHub Pages
1. Go to the repository settings in your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
3. Under "Source", select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (usually "main" or "master").
4. Click on "Save" to save your changes.
5. Your repository is now hosted using GitHub Pages. You can access it at `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/portfolioWebsite`.

### Conclusion

NFC (Near Field Communication) technology has revolutionized the way we interact with devices and share information wirelessly. Dot cards, also known as NFC tags, are small, programmable devices that use NFC technology to communicate information. They offer a convenient and efficient way to network at conferences and share information with others.

By programming a dot card with your resume, Linktree, and personal website, you can make a lasting impression on conference attendees and create valuable connections in your industry. Additionally, NFC tags can be used in various other use cases, such as:

- **Smart Posters:** NFC tags can be embedded in posters to provide additional information or promotional content when tapped with a smartphone.
- **Mobile Payments:** NFC technology is used in mobile payment systems, allowing users to make payments by tapping their smartphones or cards on NFC-enabled terminals.
- **Access Control:** NFC tags can be used for access control systems, allowing users to unlock doors or access restricted areas by tapping a card or smartphone.
- **Inventory Management:** NFC tags can be used for inventory management, allowing businesses to track and manage their inventory more efficiently.

To learn more about NFC technology and its applications, consider attending conferences and workshops dedicated to NFC technology. Here are some upcoming conferences and events related to NFC technology:
