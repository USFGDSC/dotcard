        <p>Dot cards, also known as NFC tags, are small, programmable devices that use NFC technology to communicate information wirelessly. NFC (Near Field Communication) is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to exchange data when they are in close proximity, typically within a few centimeters.</p>
<p>At conferences, dot cards can be used to exchange contact information, share digital business cards, or even link to your professional social media profiles. They offer a convenient and efficient way to network with other attendees without the need for traditional paper business cards.</p>
<p>In this codelab, we will explore how to program a dot card using an NFC-enabled device, such as a smartphone or tablet. Programming a dot card allows you to personalize it with your contact information, making it easier for others to connect with you after the conference.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Resume:</strong><ul>
<li>Keep it concise and relevant to the conference or industry.</li>
<li>Highlight key achievements, skills, and experiences that are most relevant to your networking goals.</li>
<li>Consider including a QR code on your dot card that links directly to your online resume for easy access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Linktree:</strong><ul>
<li>Use Linktree to create a simple, mobile-friendly landing page that links to your social media profiles, portfolio, blog, and other relevant online content.</li>
<li>Customize the Linktree page to reflect your personal brand and highlight your most important online assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Personal Website:</strong><ul>
<li>Make sure your personal website is up-to-date and visually appealing.</li>
<li>Include a brief bio, portfolio of work, contact information, and links to your social media profiles.</li>
<li>Consider adding a blog or news section to showcase your expertise and interests in your field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

        <p>In order to get the ground running, we primarily need two things,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An NFC Tag</li>
<li>A device with NFC Functionality</li>
</ol>
<h3 is-upgraded>Install The app to program the NFC Card</h3>
<ul>
<li>Apple : <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749" target="_blank">NFC Tools</a></li>
<li>Android : <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">NFC Tools</a></li>
</ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="Programing the NFC Tag" duration="2">
        <p>With the app installed and the NFC Tag we are all set to program it.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Open the NFC Tools app</strong> on your device.</li>
<li><strong>Tap on the &#34;Write&#34; option</strong> in the app menu.</li>
<li><strong>Select the type of information in â€˜Add record&#39; menu</strong> you want to program into the NFC Tag. For example, you can choose to write a URL, text, or contact information.</li>
<li><strong>Enter the desired information</strong> in the provided fields. For a URL, enter the web address of your Linktree or personal website. For text, you can enter a brief introduction or any other message you want to share.</li>
<li><strong>Hold the NFC Tag close to the back of your device</strong> to start the writing process. Ensure that the NFC Tag is placed on a flat surface for better communication.</li>
<li><strong>Wait for the writing process to complete</strong>. You will receive a notification when the writing is successful.</li>
<li><strong>Test the NFC Tag</strong> by holding it close to your device to see if it triggers the desired action, such as opening a web page or displaying text.</li>
